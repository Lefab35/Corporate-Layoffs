### Project Overview

This Data Analysis project aims to provide insights into massive layoffs sweeping the United States since the beginning of the Covid-14 pandemic in March 2020. By analyzing various aspects of the layoff data, we seek to identify trends, make predictions, draw conclusions, and make clear recommendations about what companies are the most affected... 


### Data Sources and Walkthrough

layoffs Data is available in various DataBase including:

Kaggle offers a reliable library for each data which helps to understands all the attributes, I do recommend to search into the internet for more detail. 
this data is also available in various format file, I personnally  downloaded lafoffs.csv file, for compatibility with excel, which is the primary program used for
1.  Data Cleanning & Formatting
2.  Data Visualization & Report
   

 ### Exploratory Data Analysis

 This process involved eexploring the layoffs data for answering key questions, such as:
 -  which companies have the highest layoffs by number where (locations) do employees got layoffed the most?
 -  What period of the year do employees has the highest likelihood rate to be terminated or hired?


### Tools

About the tool, we relied exclusively in Excel program for pretty much all step process in the data analysis.
Excel - Data Cleaning & Visualization

### Results & Findings

the Analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.  Amazon and Meta are ranked consecutively number one and second in the list of top 10 companies having the highest number one employees layoffs since 2020, and the Bay Area in California are the most affected location by the cut
2.  Companies biggest layoffs often happens from December to March. However, we observed short hiring period from may to June or September to October.


### Limitations

my recommendations is exclusevily* based on the layoffs data that was made available online. in reality it's as reliable as the dataset and could not in fact reflect the current layoffs patterns from Amazon and oters corporates. We have assumed empty cells from Total Laid Off are zero, which in fact means two things:
-  NO employees got laid off from theses companies, which is technically impossible or
-  the number of employees who got laid off is signifficantly low comparing to the average number. if the case, the actual number should have been reported in data cell.
the data integrity and accuracy is already put in jeopardy and so will be our conclusion which is strictly base upon our data
