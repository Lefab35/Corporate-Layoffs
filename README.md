### Project Overview

This Data Analysis project aims to provide insights into massive layoffs sweeping the United States since the beginning of the Covid-14 pandemic in March 2020. By analyzing various aspects of the layoff data, we seek to identify trends, make predictions, draw conclusions, and make clear recommendations about what companies are the most affected...

Kaggle offers a reliable library for each data which helps to understand all the attributes, I do recommend searching the internet for more details. 
this data is also available in various format files, I downloaded lafoffs.csv file, for compatibility with Excel, which is the primary program used for
1.  Data Cleaning & Formatting
2.  Data Visualization & Report
   

 ### Exploratory Data Analysis

 This process involved exploring the layoffs data for answering key questions, such as:
 -  which companies have the highest layoffs by number where (locations) do employees get layoffs the most?
 -  What period of the year do employees have the highest likelihood rate to be terminated or hired?


### Tools

About the tool, we relied exclusively on the Excel program for pretty much all-step processes in the data analysis.

### Results & Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.  Amazon and Meta are ranked consecutively number one and second in the list of top 10 companies having the highest number one employee layoffs since 2020, and the Bay Area in California is the most affected location by the cut
2.  The company's biggest layoffs often happen from December to March. However, we observed a short hiring period from May to June or September to October.


### Limitations

my recommendations are exclusively* based on the layoffs data that was made available online. in reality, it's as reliable as the dataset and could not reflect the current layoffs patterns from Amazon and other corporates. We have assumed empty cells from Total Laid Off are zero, which means two things:
-  NO employees got laid off from these companies, which is technically impossible or
-  the number of employees who got laid off is significantly low compared to the average number. if the case, the actual number should have been reported in the data cell.
the data integrity and accuracy are already put in jeopardy and so will be our conclusion which is strictly based upon our data
